# To-do list
The application allows users to create a list of tasks via the terminal. 
A completion date, project, notes and a status may be assigned to a given
task. And the list may be re opened in the application as long as the user 
saves the list as a .BIN file via the application. 

# How to use
From the welcome menu a user can choose to open an existing to-do list
or create a new to-do list or simply exit the application. From the main
menu the user has a number of options. Firstly add a task to the list, 
in which the user must input a completion date for the task. Secondly
the user can view the list of uncompleted tasks, sorted by completion date 
or view a list of tasks filtered by project. Thirdly, the user can find a
task in the list. If the task exists attributes associated with the task
will be shown. These attributes are explained below in # Features. Fourthly,
the user can enter Task Info and Task Editor via the main menu. Lastly, 
the user is able to save the to-do list to a .BIN file either from the 
main menu or prompted before exiting the application. 

# Features
The application includes a task information window, which allows the
user to view attributes about a specified task. Attributes include the
status of the task, alongside any notes and project if these attributes 
have been assigned to the task. The date and time of which the task was
created will be visible, and the difference between the current date and
the date of creation. Finally a reminder of the amount of time left until
the task must be completed or the time of which the task is overdue is 
shown.

The application also includes a task editor, in which the user is
able to assign a project and notes to a task. Assign a task to completed, 
edit a tasks name and finally remove a task from the list.
